Hello 👋! I’m Juanma. I have graduated from the [Universidad de Málaga](https://www.uma.es) with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and another Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics. I have also completed a cybersecurity course at the [Google Safety Engineering Center (GSEC)](https://safety.google/intl/es_es/engineering-center-malaga/) in Málaga, specifically the VI University Expert in Reverse Engineering and Malware Intelligence.

I began my studies in 2019, and in 2022, I continued my academic journey at [Uninversidade Federal Fluminense](https://www.uff.br/) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 🇧🇷. This experience not only enhanced my academic background but also ignited my passion for traveling. During this time, I also became fluent in Portuguese.

In 2023, I started working as a part-time Salesforce Developer at [Freepik](https://freepik.com), where I worked for about 9 months. However, I decided to leave the job to focus more on my studies and to seek a position that aligns more closely with deep mathematical areas.

In February 2025, I started working as a Data Engineer at [Tupl](https://www.tupl.com), where I am currently developing data-driven solutions and expanding my experience in the field of data engineering.

I am passionate about Linux and have been using it for about 5 years. The terminal has become my best friend 😊, and I strongly resonate with the philosophy behind Linux. In my free time, I enjoy going out and capturing aerial shots with my drone.

I spend a lot of time thinking about:

- Artificial intelligence and machine learning.
- Data analysis.
- Cybersecurity.

This site doesn’t have much to offer yet, except for a link to my [CV](https://juanmagd.dev/assets/pdf/CV.pdf) or my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/juanmagdev) where you can explore some of the projects I’ve worked on in the past. In the future, I plan to start writing blog posts on topics that interest me.
