Hi 👋! I'm Juanma. I am currently finishing my studies in [Universidad de Málaga](https://www.uma.es). I have graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and am completing another Bachelor's degree in Mathematics. While studying, I worked as a Salesforce Developer at [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com) for about 9 months on a part-time basis. I decided to leave the job to focus on my university studies and to seek a position more centered on deep mathematical areas.

Two years ago, I continued my studies in [Uninversidade Federal Fluminenses](https://www.uff.br/), Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 🇧🇷. This experience was amazing and opened my eyes to traveling around the world. Now speak and understand Portuguese!.

I love Linux and the philosophy behind it. I've been using Linux for about 4 years, and the terminal has become my best friend 😊. I also love going out and taking aerial shots with my drone.

I spend a lot of time thinking about:

- Artificial intelligence and machine learning.
- Data analysis.
- GNU/Linux.

Currently, I am studying to obtain a C1 Cambridge English certification while writing a scientific article based on my Bachelor's thesis.

This site doesn't have much to offer yet, besides a link to my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/juanmagdev) where you can find projects I've worked on in the past. I also plan to start writing blog posts about topics that interest me in the future.
