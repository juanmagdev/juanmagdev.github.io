I left Málaga early, heading to Torremolinos, where the ceremony was held in the city’s main <a href="https://www.google.es/maps/place/Auditorio+Municipal+Pr%C3%ADncipe+de+Asturias/@36.6211826,-4.5220781,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0xd72fb8552582c43:0x29e3d1bc3b1e0250!8m2!3d36.6211658!4d-4.5117998!16s%2Fg%2F11c6tgrbnr?hl=es&amp;entry=ttu">auditorium</a>. The decision to hold it there was due to the increased number of guests allowed—five per student—making the event even more special as we could share it with more family and friends.</p> <p>When we arrived at the auditorium, we got our first surprise of the day: the newspaper El Sur was there to cover the event. They took some photos of us and conducted interviews. It felt strange but exciting to see ourselves in the newspaper the next morning! This is the <a href="https://www.diariosur.es/universidad/graduacion-promocion-informatica-matematicas-20240701223933-nt.html">article</a>.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-12"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/1-periodico-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/1-periodico-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/1-periodico-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/1-periodico.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The ceremony began shortly after, with the usual speeches from some professors and alumni. But the highlight was when two of my classmates, Manu and Arturo, took the stage to deliver their humorous speech. They had prepared it the night before, and although it was a bit improvised, it turned out to be one of the most memorable moments of the day.</p> <p>Then came the moment we had all been waiting for: receiving our diplomas and sashes. Walking up on stage, hearing my name called, and receiving my diploma was a proud moment I will never forget.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/1-graduacion-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/1-graduacion-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/1-graduacion-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/1-graduacion.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/1-graduacion-0-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/1-graduacion-0-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/1-graduacion-0-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/1-graduacion-0.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>After the ceremony, we headed to a peculiar steakhouse for dinner. None of us had really looked into the place beforehand, but it turned out to be a fun and unique experience—just right for such a special night. And, of course, the celebration continued with a night out with the rest of our classmates.</p> <p>It was an emotional day, especially as we realized that, for many of us, it would be the last time we shared classes (or rather, exams) together. While the end of this chapter marks a new beginning, the memories of that day and the years we spent together will stay with us forever.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="academics"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[On July 1st, I celebrated my graduation—a day full of excitement and pride, where my classmates and I finally saw the hard work of the past five years pay off.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Google Gemini updates: Flash 1.5, Gemma 2 and Project Astra</title><link href="https://juanmagdev.github.io/blog/2024/google-gemini-updates-flash-15-gemma-2-and-project-astra/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Google Gemini updates: Flash 1.5, Gemma 2 and Project Astra"/><published>2024-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-05-14T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://juanmagdev.github.io/blog/2024/google-gemini-updates-flash-15-gemma-2-and-project-astra</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://juanmagdev.github.io/blog/2024/google-gemini-updates-flash-15-gemma-2-and-project-astra/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[We’re sharing updates across our Gemini family of models and a glimpse of Project Astra, our vision for the future of AI assistants.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog</title><link href="https://juanmagdev.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Displaying External Posts on Your al-folio Blog"/><published>2022-04-23T23:20:09+00:00</published><updated>2022-04-23T23:20:09+00:00</updated><id>https://juanmagdev.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://juanmagdev.github.io/blog/2022/displaying-external-posts-on-your-al-folio-blog/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author></entry></feed>
