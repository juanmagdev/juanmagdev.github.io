He loves volleyball, and I love tennis, so we decided to watch both a tennis match and a volleyball match.</p> <p>We bought the tickets and booked our flights from Málaga to Paris. Afterward, I almost forgot about it until August 2nd, when we finally flew to Paris.</p> <p>The day started early at 5 a.m. since our flight was at 8 a.m. After almost three hours, we arrived in Paris. We didn’t bring any luggage because we were only spending one day in the city, planning to return to Spain the next morning.</p> <p>Our tennis match was scheduled for 11:30 a.m., so we didn’t have time to explore Paris right away. We went directly from the airport to Roland Garros.</p> <p>We enjoyed two doubles tennis matches. The first match was between Italians Jasmine Paolini and Sara Errani, who won against Czech players Linda Noskova and Karolina Muchova, with a score of 6-3, 6-2. The second match featured Australians John Peers and Matthew Ebden, who defeated Americans Tommy Paul and Taylor Fritz, 7-5, 6-2. During the matches, we ate some sandwiches we had brought from Málaga. It was thrilling to see the Rafael Nadal sculpture, honoring the greatest player in Roland Garros history.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-12"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/jjoo/rafa-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/jjoo/rafa-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/jjoo/rafa-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/jjoo/rafa.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>Afterward, we took an Uber to the volleyball match.

Since we didn’t book a hotel, we decided to discover the city by night. We started by visiting the famous Red Light District, where we saw the iconic windmill. Next, we headed to the city center, where we marveled at the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe. We were walking past midnight, so the streets were quiet, and it felt like we had the city all to ourselves.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/jjoo/torre-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/jjoo/torre-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/jjoo/torre-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/jjoo/torre.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/jjoo/louvre-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/jjoo/louvre-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/jjoo/louvre-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/jjoo/louvre.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The most exciting moment came when we visited the Tuileries Garden, where we found the Olympic Flame.

I left Málaga early, heading to Torremolinos, where the ceremony was held in the city’s main <a href="https://www.google.es/maps/place/Auditorio+Municipal+Pr%C3%ADncipe+de+Asturias/@36.6211826,-4.5220781,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0xd72fb8552582c43:0x29e3d1bc3b1e0250!8m2!3d36.6211658!4d-4.5117998!16s%2Fg%2F11c6tgrbnr?hl=es&amp;entry=ttu">auditorium</a>. The decision to hold it there was due to the increased number of guests allowed—five per student—making the event even more special as we could share it with more family and friends.</p> <p>When we arrived at the auditorium, we got our first surprise of the day: the newspaper El Sur was there to cover the event. They took some photos of us and conducted interviews. It felt strange but exciting to see ourselves in the newspaper the next morning! This is the <a href="https://www.diariosur.es/universidad/graduacion-promocion-informatica-matematicas-20240701223933-nt.html">article</a>.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-12"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/1-periodico-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/1-periodico-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/1-periodico-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/1-periodico.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The ceremony began shortly after, with the usual speeches from some professors and alumni. But the highlight was when two of my classmates, Manu and Arturo, took the stage to deliver their humorous speech. They had prepared it the night before, and although it was a bit improvised, it turned out to be one of the most memorable moments of the day.</p> <p>Then came the moment we had all been waiting for: receiving our diplomas and sashes. Walking up on stage, hearing my name called, and receiving my diploma was a proud moment I will never forget.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/1-graduacion-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/1-graduacion-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/1-graduacion-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/1-graduacion.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/1-graduacion-0-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/1-graduacion-0-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/1-graduacion-0-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"/> <img src="/assets/img/1-graduacion-0.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>After the ceremony, we headed to a peculiar steakhouse for dinner. None of us had really looked into the place beforehand, but it turned out to be a fun and unique experience—just right for such a special night. And, of course, the celebration continued with a night out with the rest of our classmates.</p> <p>It was an emotional day, especially as we realized that, for many of us, it would be the last time we shared classes (or rather, exams) together. While the end of this chapter marks a new beginning, the memories of that day and the years we spent together will stay with us forever.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="travel"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[On July 1st, I celebrated my graduation—a day full of excitement and pride, where my classmates and I finally saw the hard work of the past five years pay off.]]></summary></entry></feed>
